# Project-3-

In this project I will build a user-friendly application that enables users to access up-to-date temperature information and a seven-day weather forecast for a specific location. Furthermore, the app should offer the functionality to save and manage favorite locations, allowing users to quickly access weather data for their preferred places directly from the home page.
